## My primary choice of Workflow

Working on smaller projects, its usually easy to control and maintain a workflow. The problem starts when the projects grow larger and more developers join the team.
Heavily inspired by Sandofsky's suggestions for Git workflow, I believe that this workflow is one of the better ones on larger projects. The best thing, it works great for smaller projects as well.
